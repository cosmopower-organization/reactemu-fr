# `ReACTemu-f(R)`

`ReACTemu-f(R)` is an emulator of the nonlinear correction to the matter power spectrum for `f(R)` gravity with massive neutrinos. It is built using the [`CosmoPower`](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower) neural emulation framework to emulate the predictions of the [`ReACT`](https://github.com/nebblu/ACTio-ReACTio) code.

Since `ReACTemu-f(R)` is a `CosmoPower` network, the syntax to use this emulator is the same as any other `CosmoPower` emulator. We report an example below, and refer to the `CosmoPower` [repository](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower), [documentation](https://alessiospuriomancini.github.io/cosmopower/) and original `CosmoPower` [paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac064) for details on the emulation framework.


## Installation

To use `ReACTemu-f(R)` you should first install `CosmoPower`. This is most conveniently done inside a `Conda` environment:

    conda create -n cp_env python=3.7 pip && conda activate cp_env

Once inside the environment, you can install `CosmoPower` with

    pip install cosmopower


## Using `ReACTemu-f(R)`

To use `ReACTemu-f(R)` you can simply instantiate a `cosmopower_NN` class and load the `.pkl` file storing the emulator:

```py
import cosmopower as cp

# load ReACTemu-f(R)
cp_nn = cp.cosmopower_NN(restore=True, 
                         restore_filename='/path/to/reactemu-fr')

# create a dict of cosmological parameters
params_fr =  {'Omega_m':        [0.3164],
              'Omega_b':        [0.04966],
              'H_0':            [67.1],
              'n_s':            [0.9647],
              'A_s':            [2.1031e-9],
              'f_R0':           [1e-6],
              'Omega_nu':       [0.0014],
              'z':              [0.],
              }

# predictions (= forward pass through the network) -> 10^predictions
spectra = cp_nn.ten_to_predictions_np(params_fr)
```
